# Inroduction
In this lab you must read the contents of a file and then write the contents to another file. You must also store the contents of a file into a list so that it can be accessed in different ways. 

Goal:
- Use the open function for reading and writing files.

Objectives:
- Create a function for reading in a file.
- Create a function for writing files.

#### Instructions
Step 1: Check that the sampletext.txt and file_ops.py files exist and are present inside the project folder. You can run the file_ops.py file by opening a terminal and executing the python3 file_ops.py command.

Step 2: Complete the read_file() function to read in the sampletext.txt file using the open function and return the entire contents of the file. 

Step 3: Complete the read_file_into_line() function so that it returns a data structure of all the contents of the file in a line-by-line sequential order.

Step 4: Fill in the write_first_line_to_file() that accepts two arguments: the contents of a file to be written and the name of an output file, and writes only the first line of the file contents into the given output file.

Step 5: Complete the read_even_numbered_lines() to return a list of the even-numbered lines of a file (2, 4, 6, etc.) 

Step 6: Fill in the read_file_in_reverse() function to return a list of the lines of a file in reverse order.
