## The Full Stack by Meta

About this Course
As you prepare for your role in back-end development, practice bringing together multiple skills to build a full-stack Django app. Youâ€™ll start by setting up an environment for a local practical project, and refactoring the front and back-ends of an existing application. You will then have the opportunity to create the front and back-ends of a new application using your full-stack developer skills.

By the end of this course you will be able to:
- Explain common concepts related to full stack development
- Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop well-structured, interactive and responsive websites
- Build a full stack application using Django that stores its data in models on a MySQL database and updates its pages with forms and API endpoints
- Describe the different environments that web applications are deployed to

To complete this course you will need previous experience with back-end development, Python, version control, databases, Django web framework and APIs.
